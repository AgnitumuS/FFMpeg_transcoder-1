# FFMpeg_transcoder

This example project can show you how to decode and encode using FFmpeg.

I tried to implement distributed encoding application, but implementation isn't complete yet.
* This project is not working well.
To check how to work decoding to encoding, you should modify a part "int ReadFrame(FFMPEG * encoder) in FFMpeg_decoder class".
If you want to see a result, please don't use "two EncodeModule" as a class when decoding.

Used : MFC, FFMPEG
